üöÄ About Me

üéì I am Jahaira Flores, a Computer Science graduate from the University of Michigan with a Minor in UX Design.

My technical expertise includes Python, C++, JavaScript, React, SQL, HTML/CSS, REST APIs, Flask, Django, and Docker.

üë©‚Äçüíª I enjoy collaborating on innovative projects and have worked on dynamic applications like a scalable search engine as a Back-End Engineer and an Instagram clone as a Front-End Engineer, focusing on creating interactive UI components. I'm also actively learning and improving my React skills.

üåé I‚Äôm passionate about leveraging technology to create impactful solutions and excited to contribute to innovative industries like entertainment and creative technology.

ü§ù As a first-generation Latina in tech, I‚Äôm committed to supporting underrepresented communities. I‚Äôm an active member of GEECS (Girls in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science) and SHPE (Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers) and participate in CodePath‚Äôs Technical Interview Prep program.

üé® Outside of tech, I enjoy exploring digital design and prototyping with Figma. I am actively learning 3D modeling in Blender and integrating it into my web development skills with Three.js.
