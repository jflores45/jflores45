🚀 About Me

🎓 I am Jahaira Flores, a Computer Science graduate from the University of Michigan with a Minor in UX Design. I am passionate about full-stack development and continuously expanding my skills in web and mobile app development. My technical expertise includes Python, C++, JavaScript, React, SQL, HTML/CSS, REST APIs, Flask, Django, and Docker.

👩‍💻 I enjoy collaborating on innovative projects and have worked on dynamic applications like a scalable search engine as a Back-End Engineer and an Instagram clone as a Front-End Engineer, focusing on creating interactive UI components. I'm also actively learning and improving my React skills.

🌎 I’m passionate about using technology to create meaningful solutions and am eager to contribute to industries like entertainment and creative technology.

🤝 As a first-generation Latina in tech, I’m committed to supporting underrepresented communities. I’m an active member of GEECS (Girls in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science) and SHPE (Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers) and participate in CodePath’s Technical Interview Prep program.

🎨 Outside of tech, I enjoy exploring digital design and UX prototyping with Figma. I am actively learning 3D design in Blender and integrating it into my web development skills with Three.js. I also enjoy reading about personal development and financial literacy.

✈️ I love traveling and discovering new places to fuel my creativity and broaden my perspective.
